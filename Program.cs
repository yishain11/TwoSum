    // 🧠 Task: Two Sum
    /*
     Given an array of integers and a target sum, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

     ✍️ Signature:
        public static int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target)

     🔍 Example:
        Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
        Output: [0, 1]

        Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
        Output: [1, 2]

        If no 2 matching numbers were found - return an empty int array.
